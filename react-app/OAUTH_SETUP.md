## 🔐 Step 4: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
2. Click "Create Credentials" at the top
3. Select "OAuth client ID"
4. Choose "Web application" as the application type

### Configure the OAuth Client:

**Name:** Base2 React App

**Authorized JavaScript origins:**

http://localhost
```

**Authorized redirect URIs:**

```
http://localhost:3000
http://localhost:3000/
```

5. Click "Create"
6. A popup will show your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
7. **Copy the Client ID** - you'll need this for your app
8. Click "OK"

## ⚙️ Step 5: Configure Your React App

### 1. Create .env File

In the `react-app` directory, create a `.env` file:

```bash
cd react-app
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Add Your Client ID

Edit the `.env` file and add your Google Client ID:

```env
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

**Example:**

```env
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456789-abcdefghijklmnop.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 🧪 Step 6: Test Your Application

### 1. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The app should open at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Test Google Login

1. Click the "Sign in with Google" button
2. Select your Google account
3. Grant permissions when prompted
4. You should be redirected to the Dashboard

### 3. Test Protected Routes

Try accessing:

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` (requires login)
- Settings: `http://localhost:3000/settings` (requires login)
- Home: `http://localhost:3000/` (public)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"

**Solution:**

- Verify that `http://localhost:3000` is in your **Authorized JavaScript origins**
- Verify that `http://localhost:3000/` is in your **Authorized redirect URIs**
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate

### Issue: "Access blocked: Authorization Error"

**Solution:**

- Make sure your email is added as a test user in the OAuth consent screen
- Verify your app is in "Testing" mode (not "Production")
- Check that you've enabled the Google+ API

### Issue: "idpiframe_initialization_failed"

**Solution:**

- Clear your browser cookies for localhost
- Try incognito/private mode
- Verify your Client ID is correct in the `.env` file

### Issue: Client ID not loading

**Solution:**

- Make sure `.env` file is in the `react-app` directory
- Variable name must be `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- Restart the development server after changing `.env`

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### For Development:

✅ Keep `.env` file in `.gitignore`
✅ Use http://localhost for testing
✅ Add only trusted test users

### For Production:

✅ Use HTTPS only
✅ Update **Authorized JavaScript origins** to your production domain
✅ Update **Authorized redirect URIs** to your production domain
✅ Move OAuth consent screen from "Testing" to "Production"
✅ Never commit Client ID or Client Secret to version control
✅ Use environment variables on your hosting platform
